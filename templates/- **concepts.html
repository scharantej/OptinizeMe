<h1>Optimization Concepts</h1>
<p>This section explains fundamental optimization concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear programming: A technique for solving optimization problems with linear objective functions and constraints.</li>
<li>Dynamic programming: A technique for solving optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.</li>
<li>Gradient descent: A technique for finding the minimum of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the negative gradient.</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts are essential for understanding optimization algorithms and their applications.</p>

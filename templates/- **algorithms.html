<h1>Optimization Algorithms</h1>
<p>This section explores various optimization algorithms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplex method: An algorithm for solving linear programming problems.</li>
<li>Interior point method: An algorithm for solving linear programming problems that is often more efficient than the simplex method.</li>
<li>Evolutionary algorithms: A class of algorithms that are inspired by natural evolution and are often used to solve complex optimization problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>These algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from finance to engineering.</p>
